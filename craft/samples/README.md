My Projects
Examples of what I have done with Minecraft: Pi Edition and its API

1. Hide and Seek - a really simple game of hide and seek for Minecraft

2. Auto Bridge - an absolutely brilliant utility (even if I say so myself) which automatically creates a bridge in front of you, no more falling off cliffs, no more having to swim across oceans, the auto bridge allows you to walk straight on

3. Massive Analogue Clock - big enough so you can walk on the arms

4. Planetary Gravity Simulator - a whole solar system simulated in minecraft

5. Snake - the classic game, Snake, built using the Minecraft API

6. Create massive 3D models - render obj 3d model files into Minecraft

7. Take a stroll around New York - Manhattan Island rendered in Minecraft

8. Create 3d Models - version 2 - an update to my 3d model to minecraft renderer, so it draw full polygons and has the ability to map materials in the model to blocks in minecraft

9. Cannon - a fully working cannon, lets blow stuff up!

10. Turning blocks into Bombs - an example of how to capture player block hits, when the player hits a block, it flashes for a few seconds then explodes destroying all the blocks around it

11. Piano - hitting certain blocks to make piano notes, ever wanted to here Twinkle Twinkle Little Star played in Minecraft

12. Sound effects - I got bored of Minecraft: Pi Edition not having any sound effects, so I decided to make my own!  Footsteps, falling, screaming, jumping, etc

13. Making a Traffic Jam - a collection of programs which show how I went from creating a traffic light to simulating a traffic jam

14. Coding shapes - an example of how to use my MinecraftStuff api extensions to create shapes and lines

15. Music Music Visualiser - an old 'graphic equaliser' in Minecraft.
